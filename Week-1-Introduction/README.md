# Week 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

## Overview

This week was an introduction to a few things. First of all, I looked into NumPy, which is a library for numerical computing in Python. I also looked into Pandas, which is a library for data manipulation and analysis. Then, I looked into Matplotlib, which is a library for data visualization in Python. Then it was time for the book where I looked into Chapter 1 and 2 of the book where we got an introduction to machine learning and training a model for classification.
