# Introduction To Machine Learning (Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn)

This is my personal repository for my journey studying Machine Learning with the book Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn by Sebastian Rashka, Yuxi (Hayden) Liu and Vahid Mirjalili. I will be following the book's content and implementing the examples in Python.
