# Introduction To Machine Learning (Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn)

This is my personal repository for my journey studying Machine Learning with the book Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn by Sebastian Rashka, Yuxi (Hayden) Liu and Vahid Mirjalili. I will be following the book's content and implementing the examples in Python.

Each week will have the resources that I used to study that week and also all the notes that I have taken. There will be hand-written notes and typed up notes. I hand write my notes first, and only after are they transferred to the typed up notes. This is to ensure that I have a good understanding of the material before I start typing it up. In the typed up notes, it will most likely be the same as the hand-written notes, but with proper formatting and structure, however sometimes I will add additional notes or insights that I have gained from the material. This will be disclosed at the top of the typed up notes.

There's also extra notes that I take for specific topics in the extra files within the weeks. There are also research papers included in there. Most likley I will not have read through all of them but keeping them there for future reading, once the basics are solidified.

Both hand-written and typed up notes will be in PDF format.

Sometimes typed up notes can differ from week to week due to improvements in my understanding or updates to the material. Please be aware of that and check my commit history for any changes.
