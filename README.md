# Introduction To Machine Learning (Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn)

This is my personal repository for my journey studying Machine Learning with the book Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn by Sebastian Rashka, Yuxi (Hayden) Liu and Vahid Mirjalili. I will be following the book's content and implementing the examples in Python.

Each week will have the resources that I used to study that week and also all the notes that I have taken. There will be hand-written notes and typed up notes. I hand write my notes first, and only after are they transferred to the typed up notes. This is to ensure that I have a good understanding of the material before I start typing it up. In the typed up notes, it will most likely be the same as the hand-written notes, but with proper formatting and structure, however sometimes I will add additional notes or insights that I have gained from the material. This will be disclosed at the top of the typed up notes.

Both hand-written and typed up notes will be in PDF format.
