# Week 2: Scikit-Learn and Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines

## Overview

This week was an introduction to Scikit-Learn, which is a library for machine learning in Python. I also looked into Logistic Regression, which is a machine learning algorithm for classification. Then, I looked into Support Vector Machines, which is a machine learning algorithm for classification. In addition, look into data-visualisation on Kaggle.
