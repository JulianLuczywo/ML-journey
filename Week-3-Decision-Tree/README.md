# Week 3: Decision Tree / Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors

## Overview

This week, I finshed off Chapter 3 that I started in the previous week, which meant looking at Decision Trees/Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors. Also looked more in-depth about Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines.
